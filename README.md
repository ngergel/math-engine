# Noah & Henry's Math Engine
A simple math engine to do various math operations.


It supports matrices, vectors, and quaternions.


For matrices:
- Basic operations.
- Matrix product.
- Determinant.
- LU decomposition.
- Inverse matrix.


For vectors:
- Basic operations.
- Dot product.
- Cross product.


For quaternions:
- Basic operations.
- Norm.
- Inverse.
- Versor.
- Rotation matrix.

In the future, the following operations will be supported:
- General matrix & vector products.
- Cramer's rule.
- Projection matrices.
- Rotation matrices.
- Echelon form of a matrix, with or without normalized diagonal.
- Eigen values & eigen vectors.
- Jordon decomposition & reduction to the Jordan canonical form.
