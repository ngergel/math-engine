# Noah & Henry's Math Engine
A simple math engine to do various math operations.


It supports matrices, vectors, and quaternions.


For matrices: Basic operations, matrix product, determinant, LU decomposition, inverse matrix.


For vectors: Basic operations, dot product, cross product.


For quaternions: Basic operations, norm, inverse, versor, rotation matrix.

---

In the future, the following operations will be supported:
- General matrix & vector products.
- Cramer's rule.
- Projection matrices.
- Rotation matrices.
- Echelon form of a matrix, with or without normalized diagonal.
- Eigen values & eigen vectors.
- Jordon decomposition & reduction to the Jordan canonical form.
